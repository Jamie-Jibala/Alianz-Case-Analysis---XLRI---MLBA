Allianz is a global insurance company that provides a variety of products, from property and health to life insurance. Like most insurers, its business depends on a steady stream of premium payments from millions of customers. In many cases, these payments are arranged through brokers, who serve as the link between policyholders and the company. Collecting premiums is essential for operational effectiveness and cash flow stability.
Direct debit is one of the ways Allianz collects premiums; the policyholder gives the insurer permission to take the premium out of their bank account automatically. The benefits of direct debit include fewer lost or late payments, less administrative work, and steady financial inflows. Allianz said that despite these advantages, direct debit use was still relatively low compared to more conventional payment options like cash-based agreements or manual transfers.
The case centers on Allianz's efforts to discover why consumers are reluctant to adopt direct debit. It offers information on product types, premium amounts, regional data (province, region, and urbanization), broker details, and consumer profiles. The company's goal is to examine these elements to spot trends in adoption and find the factors that can persuade additional clients to switch to direct debit.


This dataset contains over 450,000 records of customer and broker information related to premium payments. It's a complete look at the relationships, including details on customer and broker locations, policy specifics, and payment
methods.This extensive dataset thoroughly analyzes the variables influencing a customer's decision to use direct debit as their payment method.

Allianz has poor client adoption rates, even though it offers direct debit to collect insurance premiums. This makes it difficult to guarantee consistent financial inflows, minimize late payments, and cut administrative costs. For Allianz to create focused initiatives to increase acceptance and fortify its premium collecting process, The biggest question we're trying to answer is: why don't some people sign up for automatic payments? To solve that, we'll analyze the data to see if a customer's age, a broker's location, or a policy's details have anything to do with it.
